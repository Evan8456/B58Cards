Project Plan
--------

Project Title: Cards


Provide a one paragraph description of your project: 
This is a set of different card games. The user can choose one of the card games from
a menu and play it. Multiplayer games are played against the computer. The computer keeps
track of points/bets for the duration of the game.

What is your plan for the first week?
Implement basic modules for a generic card game
   - drawing/animation
   - points/currency/betting
   - dealing logic (keep track of who has which cards, which cards are left in the deck)
   - user interaction:
      - selecting cards
	  - clicking "buttons" (like "draw", "hit", "pass")
	  - implement "cursor" controlled by mouse or keyboard
   - common modules for manipulating cards
      - deal n cards to a player
   - data manipulation
      - how to represent players, and cards
	  - how to read/write player and card data

What is your plan for the second week?
   - War
      - implement logic modules for war
	  - complete war

What is your plan for the third week?
   - Add menu to choose game
   - Add more card games (should be pretty quick once we've got one game working since the
      other games can reuse the same modules). Some of these require simple decision making
	  by the computer implemented with FSM's
	  - black jack
	  - go fish
	  - crazy eights
	  - solitaire
	  - more if we have extra time

What is your backup plan if things don?t work out as planned?
   - Focus on completing at least war and black jack

Weekly Reports
--------------
<In this space, provide a report each week of what worked and what didn't, and what (if any) changes were made to your proposal)>

Week 1:

We added a way to print pixels to a specified position onto the monitor. In addition, we created FSM's in order to draw the card suits (clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds) and also draw a card. We also added a way to store cards in memory, and to create a player's "hand" with a linked list of cards.
